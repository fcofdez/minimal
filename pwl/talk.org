* Access path in RDBMS
** Introduction
  ACPIR is one of the seminal papers on databases systems. Published in 1979 was
  the first paper on query plan generation. It was part on the first RDBMS
  System R, implementing the model propose by Edgar F. Codd in his paper ~A
  Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks~ as a response on how to
  execute queries expressed in a higher level language (SQL).

In this talk we will explore the first implementation of a query planner.
First we'll explain a little bit about DBs history, as well as what problem
solved this paper. 
Later, we'll present the paper following the structure of the different sections in 
the paper itself.
And finally we'll see how the field of query planners has evolved over time, since
the implementation proposed in System R solved some of the problems but took some 
naive assumptions.

* Background
IBM IMS was the first database ever implemented. It
